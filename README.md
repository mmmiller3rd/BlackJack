<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is my approach to the classic card game Black Jack a.k.a. 21
### Game Rules
* Players receive cards face up, and the dealer's first card is face up and the second is face down
* Players can split their hand if their second card is the same as their first
* If a player's hand goes over 21, it's called a "BUST" and they lose
* A total of 21 on the first two cards is called a "BlackJack"
* Players will attempt to get close to 21 before the dealer
* 5-Card Charlie - if a player has 5 cards in their hand and a hand value less than 21, then regardless of what the dealer has the player wins
* You can choose to end the game whenever, but once you have lost all you money, it's game over
### Card Values
* Numbered cards are worth their face value
* Face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are each worth 10
* Aces are worth either 1 or 11
### Actions
* Players have the option to either HIT, SPLIT, DOUBLE DOWN, or STAY
* When taking a HIT, if the hand value exceeds 21 the player BUSTS and the hand is lost
* When splitting Aces you will not be able to take another hit
* You can only double down oon your first action
* When doubling down, you will receive 1 final card
### Bets
* Players start with $1000
* Black Jack pays 3:2 ex. You bet \$100 your prize \$150
* If splitting or doubling down a player must match their original bet for each new hand
